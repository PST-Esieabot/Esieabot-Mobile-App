# Esieabot-Mobile-App
The Esieabot mobile application allows you to control the robot [ESIEABOT](https://esieabot.esiea.fr/) remotely via Bluetooth.
It allows among other things:
- Robot control via 4 directional arrows
- Live camera viewing
- A return home function
- Activation of the ultrasonic sensor
- Room scan function
- A user guide
- Automatic pairing with a new robot
- Configuration of the robot's wifi via the app

<br/>*Stay tuned to the progress of the project as new features are arriving regularly!*

### The app is also available in French

# Facility
Nothing's easier ! Download [latest version](https://github.com/PST-Esieabot/Esieabot-Mobile-App/releases/tag/v1.4) of app and OS

##Robot
Mount the *esieabot.img* disk image with your favorite software (ex: [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/fr /)).

# About this project
To complete our engineering studies, we must carry out a Scientific and Technical Project. We have therefore chosen among many PST the mobile application [ESIEABOT](https://esieabot.esiea.fr/).
<br/>The objective of this project is to allow remote control of the [esieabot](https://esieabot.esiea.fr/) via a mobile application. The application must be able to launch different operating modes, have feedback on the state of the batteries, sensors, video, surrounding sound, etc. We can also imagine using several robots to organize "fights" or various competitions...
